# HTMServer_NeuralNetwork
Hierarchical Temporal Memory Based Neural Network Server

This code creates a Server that encapsulates Nupic algorithms
Some of the benefits provided by this server are below

- Server can be called by client applications that do not have to deal with the complexity of the Nupic code
- Maintains state across calls.  This is huge
- Allows you to focus on your applications
